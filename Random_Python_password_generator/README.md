# Python Random Password Generator

This project includes two lightweight Python-based password generator applications developed during my internship at **Codesoft (April 2025 – May 2025)**.

---

## `simple_password_generator.py`
- A basic script that generates secure **16-character passwords**.
- Uses core Python libraries such as **string** and **random** to create randomized character combinations.

---

## `gui_password_generator.py`
- A simple graphical password generator that generates **15-character passwords**.
- Built using **string** and **random** libraries for password logic.
- Features a minimal **Tkinter GUI**, allowing users to generate passwords through an interactive interface.
